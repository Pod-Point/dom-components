# Design system
NOTE: This is a work in progress.
If there are any components that are required in the meantime, please create an issue in github [here](https://github.com/Pod-Point/design-system/issues).

The purpose of this design system is to show how elements/components should be displayed across our many products, and the tools and processes we use to achieve this.

## TailwindCSS
To use Tailwind and the Pod Point config, first [install Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to your project and then copy the `tailwind.config.js` file into the root of your project and build the assets, we tend to use Gulp, but feel free to build as you wish.

## Fabricator
This design system has been built using [Fabricator](https://fbrctr.github.io/)

Fabricator is a tool for building website UI toolkits - _think ["Tiny Bootstraps, for Every Client"](http://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-deliverables/#tiny-bootstraps-for-every-client)_
